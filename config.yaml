options:
    resources_mirror:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            URL used to fetch resources (e.g., Kafka binaries) instead of the
            location specified in resources.yaml.
    network_interface:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            A string containing the name of a network interface, or a
            CIDR range. For split network environments, or for other
            secure environments, you may wish to bind to a specific
            network interface. You may either name the interface here,
            or specify a CIDR range that contains the IP of the
            network interface. The charm will translate that into a
            specific IP address to bind to, and drop that into the
            Kafka config. To reset the bindings, pass in 0.0.0.0.
    hostname:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            Specify the hostname that kafka will set as its advertised
            hostname. Note that all clients connecting to kafka will
            use this hostname. We\'ll setup a good default hostname
            for you, based on your cloud provider\'s DNS settings. You
            should set this manually only if you know what you\'re
            doing!
